                When I first went to the city lights area for educating children. The parents went quite repulsive about it. Even all the children were ignorant and did not obey my instructions. Thus I focused on children leaving their children aside. It went difficult but not impossible for me to make them study. I ultimately succeeded to convince children. Now they happily come with their books and pens and study. This shows that nothing is impossible if we try our best.

                  This is an incident when we were teaching kids living near Neelam society. When we felt that the spark to study was fading away from a girl named Anjani. We talked to her mother. Her mother her kids about the importance of educating her mother was much aware of the importance of education. She told us due to some circumstances she couldn't study. But she would be really very happy if her kids get enlightened and reach the place she wished to. This shows that can get great support from the family if we can encourage their kids to acquire education.

                        A large number of children we teach study in Gujarati medium and many of us being non-Gujarati found much difficulty in teaching them. It became much difficult to give knowledge. Thus we studied basic Gujarati words, letters and numbers, translated the knowledge we wanted to give into Gujarati and taught them. Language is no more a big barrier and we believe that anyone who volunteers in the group would cross it.

                          It was November 14 and we went to distribute books and pens to children as a part of the Children's Day celebration. A tiny kid did not take the chocolate we offered but snatched away a pen from one of our hands instead. All of us were surprised to see his eagerness to study. This shows how eager are many children to study.
